schemed - terminal Worms Armageddon scheme editor.

The schemed allows to quickly modify and/or create
game scheme files of Worms Armageddon by calling
it in terminal (bash, cmd, etc.) and telling some
arguments (aka keys) to it. Usage:

schemed [arguments]

For example, we'll set infinite and full-powered rope
to the scheme.wsc file:

schemed -i scheme.wsc -wnr0 10 -wnr1 5

or

schemed --input scheme.wsc --ninja-rope-ammo 10 --ninja-rope-power 5

The command above opens the scheme.wsc, makes the changes,
and overwrites the scheme.wsc, because output file wasn't set
(look for some basic args below).

For now, there are no complete usage manual,
but you can look for the basic usage tips below.
So, there are a short list of the basic arguments:

-i [FILE], --input [FILE]	Input file name
-o [FILE], --output [FILE]	Output file name
-n, --no-write			Forbids any writing operations
-p, --print			Print the containment of the input file,
				or output, if the output file is specified
-a, --about			Display the About message and exit
-h, --help			Display the Help message and exit

How the filesaving system of the schemed works: if output
file wasn't defined, schemed overwrites the input file;
else writes the changes to the output file without touching
of the input file.
If input was not defiled, but output is, schemed will create
a new scheme wile, write out the changes you've told as the args
to the output file.
If no input and no output was given, it will write the scheme
to the `out.wsc' file.
By the way, just been called (w/o args), schemed will create
the empty `out.wsc' scheme file only with signature
and version field inside.

Remember the ALL args (but not the args shown above) should
have a decimal value right after. For example:

--bazooka-ammo 5

You can look for any scheme field names and weapons codes
at http://worms2d.info/Game_scheme_file .

For example, the `Turn Time' field name can be interpreted
as argument `--turn-fime'. You also can use the short arguments:
for `--turn-time' it will look like `-ftt' with `-f' prefix means
`field'. It's same with weapons (`--holy-hand-grenade-ammo' =
`-whhg0', with `-w' prefix means `weapon'), but there are the
third arg format exist - digital. For the ammo field of grenade
it will look like `-w030', where `03' is the weapon code.
Oh, by the way, the last digit is a field switcher.
0 is an ammo field; 1 - power; 2 - delay; 3 - crate probability
(for example, --banana-bomb-delay = -wbbo2 = w072).

Beware: some short (`-wba0'-like) arguments may become wrong
due to letter conflicts (Banana Bomb - Baseball Bat).
The schemed will warn you about an unknown argument, so you
always can use the full argument.

The schemed also supports the RubberWorm features.
For example, the `-rsdet 1' arguments enables the `Shot Does
not Ends Turn' mode (`-r' prefix means `rubber'); `-rsdet 0'
turns it off. For all  RW options you can look there:
